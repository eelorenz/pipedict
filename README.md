# pipedict
Browser dictionary of pipe smoking related terms

Purpose: When participating in pipe forums, it's annoying to constantly have hobby-specific terms flagged as misspelled. By adding the following terms 
to your browser dictiionary, peace is restored.

Instructions for use:

##Firefox
Custom words kept in c:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\<randomchars>.default\persdict.dat. If it doesn't exist, rename pipedict.txt 
and drop the file here. If it does exist, append the list into it with your favorite text editor.
Alternate file locations:
Mac
 ~/Library/Application Support/Firefox/Profiles/xxxxxxxx.default/
Linux
 ~/.mozilla/firefox/xxxxxxxx.default/
 
Internet Explorer
Open C:\Users\Username\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Spelling\ and find the language folder for whichever language you use. If default.dic doesn't exist,
rename pipedict.txt and drop it here. If it does exist, open it in your favorite text editor and add the contents of pipedict.txt.

Edge
Same as Internet Explorer

Chrome
Appears to only allow adding a single word at a time. :-(
